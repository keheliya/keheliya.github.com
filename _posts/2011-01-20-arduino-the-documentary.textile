title: Arduino The Documentary
---

It is really fascinating to read occasionally about all these cool projects on <a href="http://hacknmod.com/">Hack N Mod</a> and <a href="http://hackaday.com/category/arduino-hacks/">Hack a day</a>. The new kid on the block, <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> does awesome things. I wish we had it, when we were learning about micro controllers, at school, you know, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16F84">16F84A</a> days. It takes away the steep learning curve of electronics theory, when you want to implement a cool idea quickly. <a href="http://vimeo.com/18539129">This</a> is a heart-melting documentary for any electronics geek.

My electronics/electrical engineer friends, any projects you know of that make use of this amazing piece of technology to teach/learn electronics in Sri Lanka?
