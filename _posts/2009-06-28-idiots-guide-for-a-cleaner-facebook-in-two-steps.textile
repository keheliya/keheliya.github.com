<img class="alignright" src="http://bokardo.com/images/comics/facebook-01.gif" alt="http://bokardo.com/images/comics/facebook-01.gif" width="259" height="194" />Yeah.. It's coming to a crazy peak these days! How will this guy marry? How will that gal die? What Spongebob character are you? What flavor of pie are your neighbor? Do we care? It seems.. Yes. When I saw the clean, organized, pretty fb interface getting cluttered by hundreds of these crap - quizzes day by day, I sometimes wondered what's wrong with these people. Facebook was turning into another hi5,tagged or mySpace for me.Then came.... the greasemonkey to the rescue.
<ol>
	<li>In FirefoxÂ <a title="install" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748/"> install the Greasemonkey</a> add-on. Then you will see a small monkey face at the right bottom corner of your browser window.Unlike other firefox addons which does one particular thing, Greasemonkey extension lets you add so called _'user scripts'_ which can change behavior of a web page. In the next step we are going to try one such user script.<img class="size-full wp-image-159 alignleft" title="The icon" src="http://galpotha.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/fb2.png" alt="fb2" width="127" height="121" /></li>
	<li><a title="Facebook Purity" href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/source/44459.user.js">Click here</a> to Install the Facebook Purity GreaseMonkey script. Go to facebook home and notice the difference. The <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/44459">script</a> puts a little message in the top right hand corner of your page saying how many apps were blocked.</li>
</ol>
Gone are the days, that we kept blocking them and they were born next day with a different name again, again and again like a monster in a movie of the twentieth century. I have my neat facebook home page back again.

*PS:*

You can experiment with more and more GreaseMonkey Scripts to make your surfing easier, cleaner and effective. My favourite is<a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/21977"> IMDB pirated version</a>. But try to avoid scripts which are not from userscripts.org.

If you are someone who is madly in love with these quizzes, I'm really sorry for killing off your enjoyment (and ultimate source of future predictions) ;-). I never thought this will make it to a new blog post, but the sad status messages, and angry blog posts like <a href="http://sachtheone.blogspot.com/2009/06/whats-with-all-facebook-quizzes.html">this</a> and <a href="http://angryseafood.com/tag/facebook-quiz/">this</a>,all over the web, made me do this.

If you are using Chrome instead of Firefox, try <a title="Grease Metal" href="http://greasemetal.31tools.com/">GreaseMetal</a>
